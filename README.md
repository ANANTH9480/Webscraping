Rental Market Analysis :A data-driven project where I scraped real estate rental data using BeautifulSoup, cleaned and processed it with Pandas, and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights on rental trends, location-based pricing, and furnishing impacts. Visualized findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
